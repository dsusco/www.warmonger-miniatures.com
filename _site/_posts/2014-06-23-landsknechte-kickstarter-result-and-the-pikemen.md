A big thank you to the 45 people who backed our Kickstarter project, it is officially funded as of today. I've decided to commission the pikemen with Bob Naismith despite missing the stretch goal. I'll be posting another update once I get some pictures from him and another every few weeks as the greens make their way to the US and into production models. Again, thanks to everyone who backed.
