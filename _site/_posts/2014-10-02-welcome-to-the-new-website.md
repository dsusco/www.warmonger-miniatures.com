So I've been working on this quick and dirty version of the website these past few days. It's bare bones at the moment but the [store](/store/) is here! If you missed [our Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1765086496/10mm-german-landsknechte-with-zweihander-great-swo) you can now purchase the [Zweihänder (Great Swords)](/store/10mm-landsknechte/zweihander-great-swords.html) and the [Pikeniere (Pikemen)](/store/10mm-landsknechte/pikeniere-pikemen.html) to your heart's content. Checkout is via PayPal (you don't need a PayPal account to use it) which accepts all major credit/debit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover), eChecks, bank transfers and PayPal accounts.

If you find any typos or broken links, or run into functionality problems please [contact me](/contact.html). In the meantime I'll be tinkering here and shipping out orders. Also, if you're interested, we're running the first Warmonger Miniatures Painting Contest over on the [Specialist Arms forum](http://www.forum.specialist-arms.com/index.php?topic=6557.0). There's prizes!
