Warmonger Miniatures launched its second Kickstarter this morning: [10mm German Landsknecht Arquebusiers (Handgunners)](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1765086496/10mm-german-landsknecht-arquebusiers-handgunners/). It was funded in five hours and three minutesâ€¦

It's pretty much the same deal as last time. The figures were sculpted by Bob Naismith and the funding will cover the cost to mould and cast the miniatures in lead free pewter.

It's slated to end on Sunday, May 10, 2015 at 11:59<abbr>PM</abbr>, EDT.

Price-wise, the units start at $10 USD and can get down to $9 USD depending on how many you'd like. Shipping will be an additional fee charged to you when your pledge is ready to ship (in July).
