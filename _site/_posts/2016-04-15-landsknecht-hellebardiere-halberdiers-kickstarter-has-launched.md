Warmonger Miniatures has launched its fourth Kickstarter: [10mm German Landsknecht Hellebardiere (Halberdiers)](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1765086496/10mm-german-landsknecht-hellebardiere-halberdiers).

We're sticking with what we know again: the figures were sculpted by Bob Naismith and the funding will cover the cost to mould and cast the miniatures in lead free pewter. The funding period will last until Sunday, May 1, 2016 at 11:59<abbr>PM</abbr>, EDT. The units start at $10 USD and can get down to $9 USD depending on how many you'd like. Shipping will be an additional fee charged to you when your pledge is ready to ship (in June).
