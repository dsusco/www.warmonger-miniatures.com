Once again the figures were sculpted by Bob Naismith and the funding will cover the cost to mould and cast the miniatures in lead free pewter. The funding period will last until Friday, May 26, 2017 at 11:59<abbr>PM</abbr>, EDT. The units start at $10 USD and can get down to $9 USD depending on how many you pledge for. Shipping will be an additional fee charged to you when your pledge is ready to ship (in June).
