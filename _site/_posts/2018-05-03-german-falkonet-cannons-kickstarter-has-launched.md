Warmonger Miniatures has launched its seventh Kickstarter: [10mm German Falkonet (Cannons)](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1765086496/10mm-german-falkonet-cannons).

Once again the figures were sculpted by Bob Naismith and the funding will cover the cost to mould and cast the miniatures in lead free pewter. There are three units available: cannons, horse-drawn cannons and light cannons. The funding period will last until Sunday, May 13, 2018 at 11:59<abbr>PM</abbr>, EDT. The units start at $10/11 USD and can get down to $9/9.90 USD depending on how many you pledge for. Shipping will be an additional fee charged to you when your pledge is ready to ship (in June).
