Warmonger Miniatures has launched its eighth Kickstarter: [10mm German Mortar, Organ Gun and Volley Gun](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1765086496/10mm-german-mortar-organ-gun-and-volley-gun).

Once again the figures were sculpted by Bob Naismith and the funding will cover the cost to mould and cast the miniatures in lead free pewter. There are five units available: wheeled mortars, static mortars, organ guns, volley guns and artillery crew. The funding period will last until Sunday, December 23, 2018 at 11:59<abbr>PM</abbr>, EDT. The units start at $10 USD and can get down to $9 USD depending on how many you pledge for. Shipping will be an additional fee charged to you when your pledge is ready to ship (in June).
