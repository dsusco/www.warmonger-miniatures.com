I'm happy to announce that I've added a section on each product page that will allow me to display your painted Warmonger Miniatures.

This is something I've been looking forward to for awhile, and now with a stable image hosting platform I think it should be rather easy to achieve. So feel free to [submit some of your painted works](/picture-submission/form.html) for all the other Warmasters out there to see.

Alternatively, you can tag your Instagram posts with **#PaintingWarmonger** as well.
