A few months ago I commissioned Warmonger Miniatures' first fantasy unit, Terracotta Army spearmen, with [Dancing Yak Miniatures](https://www.dancingyakminiatures.com/). The digital sculpting is nearly complete and I hope to have a Kickstarter to get them molded up and cast this August. They're an alternate take on undead, instead of skeletons the souls of these warriors are bound to terracotta statues by their masters. I'd like to do crossbowmen, calvary, chariots, artillery and maybe some big monsters in the future as well.
