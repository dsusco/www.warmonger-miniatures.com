The wingsuits just flew in from the UK, but their arms aren't tired because they have wingsuits! I got them, the leaders, battle wizard and war priest down to the caster earlier today. I have no idea what the turnaround time is going to be with Corona, but usually I'd expect to be picking these up by mid-April. We'll see how it goes.
