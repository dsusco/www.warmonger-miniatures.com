There's four new laser cut products in the store. The [20Ã—40mm Magnetic Base Bottoms](/store/bases-and-accessories/20-40mm-magnetic-base-bottoms.html) are peel and stick and allow you to move your troops around on the magnetically receptive movement cards, keeping everything in formation as they're slid over your game mat. There's three movement card sizes in the [Base and Accessories](/store/bases-and-accessories/) section for two, three or four unit formations.
