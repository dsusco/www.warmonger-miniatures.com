<p>The Lisowczycy were an infamous band of irregular light cavalry feared as much for their exploits off the battlefield as on it. As they were not paid so they obtained compensation by plundering nearby lands where they killed <q>even children and dogs</q>, often being mistaken for Tatar hordes or non-European barbarians.</p>

<p>This is a Lisowczycy (Light Cavalry) unit of twelve strips of one figure each (12 figures total). You will recieve one commander strip (pl02a), one standard bearer (pl02b) and ten rank and file strips (a mix of pl02câ€“g).</p>
