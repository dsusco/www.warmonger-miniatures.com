<p>This magnetically receptive movement card isn't magnetic, but magnets do stick to it without jumping around or aligning at weird angles. It is laser cut to be 40×120mm and allows you to quickly reposition two units in the same formation thanks to the white vinyl on the reverse side. It slides over mousepad or grass mats easily.</p>
