<p>This magnetically receptive movement card isn't magnetic, but magnets do stick to it without jumping around or aligning at weird angles. It is laser cut to be 60x120mm and allows you to quickly reposition three units in the same formation thanks to the white vinyl on the reverse side. It slides over mousepad or grass mats easily.</p>
